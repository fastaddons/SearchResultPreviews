What does this mean?
"Search Result Previews" is not an open source. I use some open source tools to build it, but the addon itself is closed source.

Why?
I'm not a hobby programmer, I work on my addons full time for several years now and I would like to continue doing so.
So eventually I'm trying to make some money out of it.
I know it's possible with open source as well, but it's probably easier with closed source. Hence my paid version for Safari (in progress).

Is it safe to use non-open source software?
Sadly, there is no difference - in fact, in the past several open source software were sold to an unknown 3rd party and become malware without any warning (for example "Nano Defender").
It's not like the author has to submit the same version as he has in the github repository! It's a false sense of security.
It's always important that you trust the author of the addon, not the addon itself.

I'm not gonna sell my addons to anyone and I don't plan to retire any time soon as I'm only 34 years young :).

I hope they make you more productive!
