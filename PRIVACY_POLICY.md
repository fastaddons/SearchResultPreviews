# Privacy Policy
Search Result Previews doesn't collect any data.  
User preferences (options page data) are stored only locally and are accessible only by extension itself.

In the version 1.x, all thumbnails will come from domain:    
https://temp-images.fastaddons.com/

This domain points to the server of the original author of "Search preview" extension (made by Edward Ackroyd), so his privacy policy applies:  
https://searchpreview.de/privacy-policy-chrome.html

In the version 2.x and above, new domain will be used which will serve images from my own server:  
https://srp.fastaddons.com/

There is no tracking of any kind. No personal information is transferred.  

### Upcoming Freemium model ###
Existing features will stay forever free and without ads.  
New versions will add new "premium" features which will require payment.  
I will add more details later on as it will depend on the final server cost, mostly the cost of generating new page thumbnails.  

These things are not cheap, so your support is very welcomed!
